# Information
This repository originally started off as a means of using Python to learn music theory, specifcally guitar theory, since the basis of musical sound can be described mathematically *(in acoustics)* and exhibits a remarkable array of number properties.

It is still a work in progress, so some functions and features may not work as excepted or at all. Would love some collaboration on this project!
